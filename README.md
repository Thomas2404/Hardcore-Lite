# Hardcore Lite
*A Minecraft plugin designed for small survival multiplayer servers.*

Allows you to play a more forgiving version of Minecraft's own hardcore game mode.

Players start with 5 lives and are given opportunities to earn more through achievements and trading.




## Features

- Several intuitive commands, such as the abilitiy to give other players one or more of your lives, and view all players remaining lives.
- Anouncements when players lose a life.
- Name colors that change depending on the players remaining lives.
- Achievements that grant players more lives when completed.
- Penalty system for killing other players.
- Option to remove players from the server after they reach 0 lives, or allow them to continue playing.

## Usage

- Do /hcl in game for a list of commands.
- By default, the plugin will not ban players when they reach 0 lives. If you want to change this, open the config.yml file in a text editor and change BanPlayersOn0Lives: from 'no' to 'yes'.
